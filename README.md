# Custom Fedora Kinoite OS Build

This repository contains configuration files to build a customized version of Fedora Kinoite with additional software pre-installed. This is customized for my use, so you probably want to use this as inspiration at most, and not use it directly. The custom image includes gaming tools, development utilities, privacy-focused applications, and networking tools.
